              The first word. What was the first word ever said by a human being
              on earth? What was your children’s first word? Was it something to
              ‘summon’ you? Why was that? Was it because they needed you? How
              many times did they say that first word? When they were hungry?
              When did they fall after their first steps? When they hurt their
              knee after they fell from their bike the first time? Or when they
              were packing to leave you for the first time? What was your first
              word? Are you still saying it? When do you say it? Do you still
              need it? Will your children say it even after you die?

              An oriental scholar says that every good thing starts with it. And
              every creature repeats it again and again, consciously or
              unconsciously. He tells us a story; Once upon a time, two men
              enter a foreign realm for a journey. One of them seeks the
              protection and takes the name of the king of the realm to travel
              safely. The other is proud says who cares I am good on my own.
